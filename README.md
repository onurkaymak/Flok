## üåê About the Project

### üìñ Description

*Flok* is a fleet management tool that is made for car rental companies. It allows users to create/track vehicles in the inventory, track production status, current detailing numbers, and information about current reservations. 

All the features work based on authentication and authorization, different employee roles have different access levels in the app. These roles are "Auto Detailer", "Customer Service Agent", and "Manager".

It's a full-stack application that is built on React with Redux & ASP.NET Web API with MySQL. While Flok(this repo) works as a front-end that allows a dynamic and better user experience, Flok API allows this tool to expand on mobile development with React Native (WIP).
